# TempSensorWithFPGAs
Displaying the environmental temperature using the ADT7420 Temperature Sensor of a Nexys A7 or even on a Nexys 4 DDR.

The purpose of this project is to read the environmental temperature surrounding the board used.
For this project we used a "Digilent Nexys 4 DDR with its Artix-7 FPGA Chip".
The temperatures will be determined both in Celsius and Fahrenheit using its 8-bit display.
Likewise : dd°C|dd°F --> d = digit

We make use of its integrated temperature sensor, which is an ADT7420.
